# The-benefits-of-dance-sport
I created a simple and accessible website for my college graduation project using JavaScript and CSS. The website provides detailed information about the health benefits of dance sport, including sections dedicated to various physical, mental, and health advantages. Additionally, I incorporated an attractive design with relevant images, a contact page, and useful resources for those interested in learning more or participating in this sport. The website is aimed at providing the general public with everything they need to know about dance sport and how to get involved.
